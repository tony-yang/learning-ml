Machine Learning coding practice

## Environment Setup
Due to the use of plotting, most of the code will not run inside a container but directly on the host environment. To setup the host environment, install Python 3, and install the packages below
```
pip3 install --upgrade pip numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
